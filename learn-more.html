                            <h2>Ormus, O.R.M.E.’s and Monatomic/Monoatomic Materials</h2>
                            <h3>What is it, or more accurately, what are they?</h3>
                            <p><strong>by Kevin Hay</strong></p>
                        
                            <p>These materials have been referred to as High Spin State Superconducting Materials. Some of the modern names are ORMUS, ORME’s, and White Powder of Gold. However, Monoatomic gold and Ormus are not the same compound.</p>
                        
                            <p>Monoatomic gold is produced using an acidic reaction, breaking pure gold down into its singular atomic counterpart. Ormus is a composition of materials extracted through an alkaline reaction. Ormus is NOT monoatomic gold.</p>
                        
                            <p>Ormus contains many different elements. It is extracted from seawater using an alkaline process. Ormus contains zinc, magnesium, calcium, iron, and a plethora of other essential elements and minerals. Monoatomic gold does not!</p>
                        
                            <p>Plants and animals use an acidic process to extract specific materials from food and soil. Hydrochloric acidification allows for these metals to bond with water, which provides the water-soluble reaction that allows them to be absorbed and applied as building blocks for the formation of organic matter. These elements are literally the building blocks for cells in both animals and plants. Plants excrete hydrochloric acid at their root tips, while animals have gastrointestinal acidification processes.</p>
                        
                            <h3>History and Ancient Knowledge</h3>
                            <p>In the 1970s, a fellow named David Hudson claims to have “discovered” this compound. However, history shows us differently.</p>
                        
                            <p>Ormus has been well known throughout history and is described in ancient cultures by many different names, despite the claims made by Hudson. The ancient Egyptians called it “Shewbread,” while the Israelites referred to this as Manna. David Hudson created the term ORME’s, an acronym describing “Orbitaly re-arranged monoatomic elements.” Due to the use of a double singular, the term “Monoatomic” is redundancy. The singular term is atomic. The correct terminology is atomically separated, or Inductively Separated Atomic Elements.</p>
                        
                            <p>These compounds have many names, also known as Elixer, Manna, Shewbread, the snot, AuM, the polymers, mHstate, ShemHanHna, micro clusters, super deformed high H spin elements, exotic atoms, Semen of the Gods (I almost left that one out…), SchefaFood, Bread of the Presence of God, MFKZT, Elixir of Life, the lapis, the Sophic Hydrolith of the Wise, Erinaes, Philothes, Philolithes, Apaitu, Batu, Surgawi, Bubuk Putih, Mannadan Salwa, chrysopoeia, dew, occult gold, aurum potable, water of gold, and also The Philosophers’ Stone, among many other names. Many of these terms existed long before David Hudson’s gold extraction processes showed him a white, powdery substance collecting.</p>
                        
                            <h3>Scientific Insights</h3>
                            <p>Just like iron breaking down into iron oxide (rust), other types of elements break down in a similar manner. However, gold has some rather interesting characteristics. Gold does not oxidize like iron does, but it still breaks down into smaller valances over time through acidic processes and even through electrical interactions. When the molecular structure of matter is altered, its characteristics will change, just as iron does when it couples to oxygen and becomes water soluble.</p>
                        
                            <p>These compounds may be the material bridge between chemistry, biology, and the physics of electricity and its corresponding relationship with matter. Torsion-based compression provides the groundwork for a better understanding of resistance, friction, and electricity. I believe that electricity is a crucial aspect that is often ignored. Mineral salts are everywhere on this planet and also in our bodies.</p>
                        
                            <h3>The Brain as an Interferometer</h3>
                            <p>Our brain is an interferometric accumulator. What the heck is that, you ask? An interferometer is a mechanism for the collection and accumulation of opposing magnetic fields and which has the capacity of coupling these fields into an electromagnetic reaction. Our brain has a bi-toroidal reaction occurring inside of it. This is the mechanism, the motor, the generator that creates our body’s electromagnetic processes and reactions.</p>
                        
                            <p>The myth of using only 15 percent of our brain is exactly that, a myth. We use all of our brain. All of it. Our brain has a similar function to that of a crystal refraction or a Piezo reaction. It separates magnetic waveforms and then combines opposing magnetic waves into an electromagnetic reaction. This is bio-electricity. The conduit for this reaction, the transfer mechanism between the chemical and the mineral and the bio-organic transfer of energy, is through this Orbital Reaction.</p>
                        
                            <p>Our brain has two hemispheres for this reason. It couples these waveforms at the same frequency as the longitudinal waves on our planet’s surface, 7.83 Hertz. This pulse induces the reaction necessary to decouple the chloride bonded inductive materials in our bloodstream, which provides the transfer of inductive fields into the mitochondria, the power plant of the cell, allowing the bi-toroidal reaction of the ATP conversion to take place.</p>
                        
                            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
                            <p>Several scientists have written articles attempting to explain these reactions in a different manner:</p>
                            <blockquote>
                                <p>“Monoatomic atoms have been observed to exist in all the heavy elements in the center of the periodic table. These are the elements which have 'half-filled' bands of valence electrons and include the following elements. Their atomic numbers are given in parenthesis (the atomic number represents the number of protons in the nucleus.) Ruthenium (44), Rhodium (45), Palladium (46), Silver (47), Osmium (76), Iridium (77), Platinum (78), and Gold (79). Other metallic elements in the same part of the periodic table have also been observed in micro clusters. Because the atoms of monoatomic elements are not held in a rigid lattice network, their physical characteristics are quite different from atoms which are locked in the lattice. Thus, it is the grouping of atoms which defines the physical characteristics of the element; not just the number of neutrons and protons in the nucleus as previously believed. If you don’t have a lattice network, you don’t have a metal even though the atoms of the two forms of matter are identical.”</p>
                            </blockquote>
